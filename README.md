# Hook Table for React

The project was initiated with the goal of developing a straightforward and easy-to-use type-safe table rendering engine. Although there are more feature-rich alternatives available, the emphasis here is on simplicity for projects where complex data tables are unnecessary.

The project is still under development, but most of the basic functionality should remain unchanged.
